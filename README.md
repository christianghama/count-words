# count-words
I like to start my learning journey of new languages (like French, Spanish, English etc.) by reading before listening or speaking. I start by reading the most I can: books, articles, news etc. By reading you become familiar with the structure of the language and increase your vocabulary. 

When reading a text, I try to identify the words that appear more frequently, because that are the words that I have to memorize first. Before using computers to assist my learning process, I tried to manually count the occurrency of every word, taking notes directly in the text or in a separate notebook or piece of paper.

Now, with the advent of Python and other script languages, we can automate such tasks. This script is one example of how to do this automation.
