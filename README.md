# Count Words Python Script
![robot-reader](./Images/reader-robot.png)

I like to start my learning journey of new languages (like French, Spanish, English etc.) by reading before listening or speaking. I try to read the most I can: books, articles, news etc. By reading you become familiar with the structure of the language and also increase your vocabulary, making the next steps of listening and speaking much easier.

When reading a text, I try to identify the words that appear more frequently, because I know that are the words I have to memorize first. Before using computers to assist my learning process, I tried to manually count the occurrency of every word, taking notes directly in the text or in a separate notebook or piece of paper.

Now, with the advent of Python and other script languages, we can automate such tasks! This script is one example of how to do this automation. You can use it to count the occurrency of words in text of any Western languages, such as English, Spanish, French, Italian, etc. However, I haven't tried it in text written in Eastern languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, Arabic etc., but I'd love to receive any feedback of users that tried to use it that way.
